# Melanoma Detection CNN Model
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Melanoma detection CNN model by Sandeep Singh.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- We are trying to detect presence of Melanoma by analysing digital images of the patients effected area

## Conclusions
- We are able to detect the same with 30% accuracy with more traning data and a higher configuration hardware setup we can increase the number of layers and Epochs and increase this accuracy 

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0
- Tensorflow
- Keras
